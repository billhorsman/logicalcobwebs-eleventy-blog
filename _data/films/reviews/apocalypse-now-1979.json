"The Doors' soundtrack, the helicopters, the <em>Ride of the Valkyries</em>, <em>(I Can't Get No) Satisfaction</em> while surfing the boat's wake. There are too many iconic moments to count. The opening scene of Willard doing something akin to Tai Chi with <em>The End</em> in front of the mirror. What a start. Brando's brief appearance as the Colonel is perfect."
