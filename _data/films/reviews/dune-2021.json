"I've read all five books several times so I have a high bar for whether this film does the book justice. Happy to say it definitely does. The ornithopters are spot on. The sandworms are even harder to get right but they are good too. Hans Zimmer's score adds an extra layer. How they portray The Voice is perfect."
