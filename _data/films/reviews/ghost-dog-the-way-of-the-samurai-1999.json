"I was hooked as soon as I saw this and I've seen it many times since. The music and Ghost Dog's stare are hypnotic. I love the way the pigeons fly to the music like it's a dance. The readings from Hagakure work perfectly. Then there is the friendship with Raymond with no common language and complete understanding. I can't say enough about this film."
