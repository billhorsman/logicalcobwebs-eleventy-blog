"I could have picked anything from the  Wright/Pegg/Frost trio (Shaun of the Dead, The World's End) but this is my favourite. I've been a Simon Pegg (and Jessica Stevenson) fan since the TV series <em>Spaced</em>. Wonderfully silly with many references to classic films (Dirty Harry, Point Break, etc.)."
