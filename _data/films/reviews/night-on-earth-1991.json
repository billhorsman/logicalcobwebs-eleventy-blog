"Five vignettes across LA, New York, Paris, Rome and Helsinki — all told from five different taxis. Tom Waite's soundtrack is a common thread and you can't have too much Tom Waites. It's hard to pick a favourite but maybe I'll go with Roberto Benigni and his one-sided conversation with the priest. Or perhaps Isaach de Bankolé and Béatrice Dalle in Paris. I only recently realised that Giancarlo Esposito played both YoYo here and Gus Fring in Breaking Bad."
