"What a beautiful film. It was made in 2025 but feels exactly like it was shot in 1960 — like a documentary of the making of Breathless. In black and white of course, but it goes further than that. It's a deep attention to all the details. I can't wait to watch this again and to watch Breathless again too. The resemblence and style of Zoey Deutch and Aubry Dullin to Jean Seberg and Jean-Paul Belmondo is uncanny."
