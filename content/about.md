# About Logical Cobwebs

Founded in 1994, Logical Cobwebs was a consultancy service for [Bill Horsman](/bill) and [Nonie Coulthard](/nonie) although Bill has worked full time for [Team Tito](https://teamtito.com/) since 2018.


<p>
  The company was registered in England as
  <a
    href="https://find-and-update.company-information.service.gov.uk/company/02986705"
    >Company No. 2986705</a
  >
  but it was dissolved in 2024, just shy of its 30th birthday. Bill and Nonie continue to work and our emails remain unchanged, but the company itself is no more.
