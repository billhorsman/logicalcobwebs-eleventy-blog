## Favourite Films

{% set firstFilm = films[top_films[0]] %}
{% set lastFilm = films[top_films[top_films.length - 1]] %}
Starting from {% filmLink firstFilm.slug %} in {{ firstFilm.year }} through to {% filmLink lastFilm.slug %} in {{ lastFilm.year }}, here are my {{ top_films.length }} favourite films. There are lots that are brilliant and don't make the cut but it's a nice round number. 

Based on these films, my favourite directors are {% namesAndCounts top_directors, 5 %}.

Actors that crop up a lot are {% namesAndCounts top_cast, 6 %}.

A few films are in here because I watched them a long time ago and they have a nostalgic appeal. Films like {% summariseFilms nostalgic_films %}.

Some older films I only discovered relatively recently: {% summariseFilms ["la-strada-1954", "la-dolce-vita-1960", "dog-day-afternoon-1975"] %}.

One film is in here twice: {% filmLink "purple-noon-1960" %} (aka Plan Soleil) and {% filmLink "the-talented-mr-ripley-1999" %}. I would have added it again for Steven Zaillian's 2024 TV miniseries <em>Ripley</em> with Andrew Scott but that's not a film.

Only one person is connected with more than one film in my top 5: Isaach de Bankol√©, who plays a Parisian cab driver in {% filmLink "night-on-earth-1991" %} and Raymond in {% filmLink "ghost-dog-the-way-of-the-samurai-1999" %}.
