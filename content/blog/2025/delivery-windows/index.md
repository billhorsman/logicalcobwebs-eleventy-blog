Delivery companies try to give you helpful information about when your delivery is coming. They often fall short in how truthful and transparent those messages are. This is my shout into the abyss.

### The email at 12:00

<blockquote class="bad">
  <span class="sr-only">Bad example:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 14:19 and 14:49
</blockquote>

**False accuracy**: Don't pretend to know within a minute.

<blockquote class="good">
  <span class="sr-only">Suggested alternative:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 14:15 and 14:50
</blockquote>

### Click the link at 13:00

<blockquote class="bad">
  <span class="sr-only">Bad example:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 14:09 and 14:39
</blockquote>

**Earlier window**: if you are out and had arranged to get back in time then moving the window earlier breaks the contract. 

<blockquote class="good">
  <span class="sr-only">Suggested alternative:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way. We did say we would arrive between 14:15 and 14:50 but we might be 10 minutes early. If you're not in then we'll wait until 14:15.
</blockquote>

### Refresh at 14:30

<blockquote class="bad">
  <span class="sr-only">Bad example:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 14:30 and 15:00 
</blockquote>

**Moving window**: admit that it might be late, don't just move the window. 

<blockquote class="good">
  <span class="sr-only">Suggested alternative:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way. We did say we would arrive between 14:15 and 14:50 but we might be 10 minutes late. Sorry.
</blockquote>

### Refresh at 14:37

<blockquote class="bad">
  <span class="sr-only">Bad example:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 14:37 and 15:07 
</blockquote>

**Guessing the window:** don't just move the window to always be 30 minutes into the future.

<blockquote class="good">
  <span class="sr-only">Suggested alternative:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way. We did say we would arrive between 14:15 and 14:50 but we might be late. Sorry.
</blockquote>

### Refresh at 15:00

<blockquote class="bad">
  <span class="sr-only">Bad example:</span>
  Your delivery is on its way and will arrive between 15:00  and 15:30
</blockquote>

**Meaningless window:** don't pretend to know when you are arriving.

<blockquote class="good">
  <span class="sr-only">Suggested alternative:</span>
  Your delivery is still on its way. We did say we would arrive between 14:15 and 14:50 but we are running late. Sorry.
</blockquote>

That's not too hard, is it?
