I'm running the [Edinburgh Marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/) again on 25 May 2025. It's in aid of [Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/) and I'd really appreciate your support. 

I raised Â£412 in 2024 and I'd really like to beat that this year. In return, I promise to run a tiny bit faster.<sup>*</sup>

You can donate on my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/bill-runs-edinburgh-marathon-2025">Just Giving</a> page.

Thank you.
