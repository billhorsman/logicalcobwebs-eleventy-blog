I'm running the [Edinburgh Marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/) again on 25 May 2025. It's in aid of [Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/) and I'd really appreciate your support. 

I raised Â£412 in 2024 and I'd really like to beat that this year. In return, I promise to run a tiny bit faster.<sup>*</sup>

You can donate on my <a href="https://www.justgiving.com/page/bill-runs-edinburgh-marathon-2025">Just Giving</a> page.

You can also find me on [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/billhorsman) and see my runs in [2022](https://www.strava.com/activities/7222828186/overview) and [2024](https://www.strava.com/activities/11503062473/overview). 

Thank you.
