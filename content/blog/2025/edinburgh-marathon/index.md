I'm running the [Edinburgh Marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/) again on 25 May 2025. It's in aid of [Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/) and I'd really appreciate your support.

I raised £412 in 2024 and I've already beaten that this year. In return, I promise to run a tiny bit faster.<sup>*</sup>

## Update 26 May 2025

I finished in 4:43:29 and raised £1,100. Thank you everyone for raising that much for Macmillan Cancer Support and giving me the motivation not to walk in the last 5k.
