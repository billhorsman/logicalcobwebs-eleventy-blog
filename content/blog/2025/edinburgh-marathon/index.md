I'm running the [Edinburgh Marathon](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/) again on 25 May 2025. It's in aid of [Macmillan Cancer Support](https://www.macmillan.org.uk/) and I'd really appreciate your support.

I raised ¬£412 in 2024 and I've already beaten that this year. In return, I promise to run a tiny bit faster.<sup>*</sup>
