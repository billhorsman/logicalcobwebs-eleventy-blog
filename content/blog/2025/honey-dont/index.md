From the opening credits I was hooked: a disjointed drive through a desolate looking Albuquerque with credits shown on the sides of buildings, road signs, hoardings and shop names. It would have been cheaper, I suspect, to digitally superimpose the credits onto the buildings but I'm pretty sure these were real pieces of graffiti and art. A nice touch.

The film is sort of timeless, in the sense it's hard to tie down when it's supposed to be set. Mobile phones set if firmly in the now but everything else could be from anytime over the past 50 years. It works.

Qualley's title character, Honey, oozes style and cool. The plot sort of drifts along while still being engaging. I'd say it's not a thriller, not an action movie — more of a drama with murder and violence. 

Seen at the [DCA](https://www.dca.org.uk/) on 25 September 2025. Go and see it if you can. It's glorious on the big screen.
