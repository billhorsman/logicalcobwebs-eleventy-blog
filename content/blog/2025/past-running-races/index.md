I look to [Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/5349071) as the primary source for all my running data but I only joined Strava on 23 June 2014 and my brain is almost forgetting (has forgotten?) stuff I did before that. This is an attempt to remember and a work-in-progress.

## Marathons

I've run two different marathons (the [Dramathon](https://www.thedramathon.com/) along the river Spey and [Edinburgh](https://www.edinburghmarathon.com/)) a total of six times.

### Dramathon 2018

20 October 2018, [5:25:19](https://www.thedramathon.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Dramathon-full-2018.pdf) (aged 51)

My first marathon and one for which I didn't train enough. I was under the impression that the second half would be slightly harder than the first half and that I could just grit my teeth and it would all be fine. I don't have any splits but I think the second half took a whole hour longer than the first half. I was "running" at a walking pace by the finish.

### Dramathon 2019

19 October 2019, [4:38:53](Dramathon-2019.pdf) (aged 52)

My second marathon and I trained better for this one. Improved by around 47 minutes.

### Edinburgh 2022 (aged 55)

29 May 2022, [4:28:19](https://www.myrunning.uk/emf-marathon-2022/results-stats?entry_id=1201689&race_number=10809&people_id=674652)

My 3rd marathon. Splits were 10k: 57:14, Half: 2:06:55, 30k: 3:04:00. Race number 10809. Ran with George all the way. A PB by more than 10 minutes, but Edinburgh is a fast course (all paved, not very hilly).

### Dramathon 2022

15 October 2022, [4:52:52](Dramathon-2022.pdf) (aged 55)

My 4th marathon. Didn't feel well a few weeks before the race and although I had recovered by the day it had an impact. Ran with George but he left me at 30k and easily beat me.

### Edinburgh 2024

26 May 2024, [4:29:09](https://www.myrunning.uk/emf-marathon-2024/results-stats?entry_id=1388686&race_number=12968) (aged 57)

My 5th marathon. Splits were 10k: 1:00:57, Half: 2:12:31, 30k: 3:11:16. Race number 12968. Not a PB but definitely a victory for pacing. 6 minutes slower at halfway than the year before but only 50 seconds slower overall. My plan was to not push it until 30k and then slowly wind up. In hindsight, I think I could have pushed _slightly_ harder from 25k onwards.

### Dramathon 2024

19 October 2024, [4:40:31](dramathon-2024.pdf) (aged 57)

My 6th marathon. A little slower than Dramathon 2022 but I felt good. Ran with George until about 30k then went on ahead (his training had not gone as well as mine). Finished feeling good (was able to do a jog warm down).

## Parkruns

I started running Parkrun in 2019 at Camperdown, Dundee. I defer to [Parkrun](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/parkrunner/6253485/) for up to date stats. My PB is currently [23:39](https://www.parkrun.org.uk/forfarloch/results/152/) on 5 April 2025 at Forfar.

## Long and distant past

### TC10k 2011

10k: 1 May 2011, [48:36](https://sportstats.one/results/38792) (aged 44)

Tracked this result down online. I think I could get within a minute or two of this time now but I think this might be a PB I can't beat. This is a flatish run in Victoria, British Columbia (where we were living at the time). 

### Robin Hood Half Marathon 1991

21.1k: 1991, 1:38 (aged 24)

I don't imagine the results for this exist anywhere, let alone online. My mind dimly remembers this race but I do remember being handed a Melton Mowbray pork pie at the finish (they were sponsors). I think my time was 1:38 but I could be wrong. It means a pace of 4:39/km which sounds possible. I was a very fit canoeist back then but didn't run much.
