Last Sunday morning I was emptying the ash from our wood pellet furnace — something I've done around 100 times.

## A small mistake

It takes about 15 minutes including the 10 minutes it takes for the machine to switch off and on. This time, 10 seconds after switching it on, I realised that I'd forgotten to put the ash trays back in. That's a silly mistake but the consequences aren't too bad. The correct resolution is to switch it off, put the trays back in and then switch it on again.

## The quick fix

That would take between 5 and 10 minutes though and I thought that if I was quick then I could just open the door, pop the ash trays in, close the door and be done in a few seconds.

## The bigger mistake

What actually happened was that as I opened the door, a mechanism to clean the burner started to operate and a metal tray slid out blocking the door from closing again. Now I couldn't close the door and the cleaning mechanism was stuck mid-clean because the door was open.

## The longer fix that didn't work

No problem, I thought. There's a service menu to allow you to operate various mechanisms manually. But that's protected by a password to stop idiots like me messing with it. I'm pretty sure it's a factory password so I searched the Internet to see what it is. Sure enough, it is the furnace temperature plus the letters "EST". I wasn't sure what that temperature was so guess 70°, then 60° and finally 65° which does work. After 30 minutes of poking around in the settings I'm not supposed to touch I gave up and resigned myself to calling an actual, qualified engineer the following day.

## Solution appears from nowhere

I went out for a bike ride but this problem was niggling away in the back of my mind. On the way home it occurred to me that if I could fool the furnace into thinking the door was closed, it might reset itself.

As soon as I'm home I take a closer look and eventually find a little micro-switch. As soon as I press it, the furnace starts its switch-on sequence and after ten seconds, it retracts the tray and I can finally close the door properly.

## Off and on again

Ten minutes later, and it was whirring away but still not heating any water. I switched it off and on again. This time it worked and our water started getting hot again.

## Day job

The parallels with my day job as an engineer at Team Tito are strong:

- Trying to do something trivial and making a simple mistake that isn't actually very serious
- An attempt to fix it quickly that causes a much bigger one
- Trawling the Internet for answers
- Trying things I don't really understand
- An attempt to fix it quickly that causes a much bigger one
- Coming up with the solution while thinking of something else entirely
- Have you tried switching it off and on again?
